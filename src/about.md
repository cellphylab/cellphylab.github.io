## About us

Biophysics Australia is an emerging community of Australian researchers with interests in the fields of biophysics, physical biology or quantitative biology broadly defined. We are not a professional society and have no fees or top-down governance. We aim to foster an engaged and interactive community of researchers from undergraduates to faculty and encourage the participation of researchers at all levels and from both academia and industry.

Biophysics Australia was started by Senthil Arumugam, Harrison York and Abhishek Patil who are researchers at Monash University, Melbourne and are affiliated with EMBL Australia. Our personal research interests lie in fluorescence microscopy and image analysis tools, intracellular trafficking cell-mechanics, and modelling biological processes.

Please get in contact with us if you would be interested in reaching out to the community or getting involved.
